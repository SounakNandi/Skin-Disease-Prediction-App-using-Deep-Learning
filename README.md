## üìå Overview
Skin diseases are a significant global health concern, affecting millions of people. Many cases remain undiagnosed due to a lack of dermatologists, high costs, and time-consuming manual diagnoses.

This project presents an automated skin disease detection system that uses CNNs to analyze skin images and classify different types of skin diseases, including benign and malignant lesions. The system was trained using publicly available dermatology datasets and employs image processing techniques for accurate classification.


## Data Collection

1Ô∏è‚É£ The dataset is sourced from Kaggle ISIC 2019, containing 3,200+ labeled skin disease images.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ This collection contains¬†high-quality RGB-formatted pictures. All the data in this dataset is balanced in condition.
